{"description": "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $$$n$$$ intersections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $$$v$$$ to another intersection $$$u$$$ is the path that starts in $$$v$$$, ends in $$$u$$$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection $$$s$$$ and works in a building near the intersection $$$t$$$. Every day he gets from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_k$$$, where $$$p_1 = s$$$, $$$p_k = t$$$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $$$s$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $$$v$$$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $$$s$$$ to $$$v$$$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $$$v$$$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $$$w$$$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $$$w$$$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $$$w$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $$$t$$$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ ($$$s = 1$$$, $$$t = 4$$$): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at $$$1$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. There is only one such path, it is $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$2$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$2$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, for example, $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ (note that it could choose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$3$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$3$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, which is $$$[3, 4]$$$;  Polycarp arrives at $$$4$$$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get $$$2$$$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ instead of $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ during the second step, there would be only $$$1$$$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $$$[3, 4]$$$ during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same.

Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well — symmetry is beautiful!Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n = 6 that cover all possibilities.  The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0.

{"description": "Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p = [p1, p2, ..., pn] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p = [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] is (421)(5)(63).Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] will become [4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3].Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list.

What could be better for high quality identification?But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.

When the head coder came home after work he wanted to re-do the trick. Unfortunately, he didn't remember the starting or the final position of the cups.
